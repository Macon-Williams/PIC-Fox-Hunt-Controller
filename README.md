# PIC Fox Hunt Controller
The PIC Fox Hunt Controller is a project designed to integrate a transceiver with a PIC18F27K42 microcontroller for the purposes of radio direction finding. The "fox" (a microcontroller connected with the transciever) is hidden and the contestants must find it using directional antennas. The firmware for the microcontroller is contained in this repository.

## Inspiration
This project is based upon Skyler Fennell's Arduino fox hunting firmware.
